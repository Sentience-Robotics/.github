# Sentience Robotics

## Overview  
This project aims to develop an AI-driven software framework for humanoid robots, with [**InMoov**](https://inmoov.fr/) as our primary testing platform. Our goal is to create a system that enables natural and dynamic human-robot interaction by integrating advanced AI models, including a custom model developed by our team.  

The software will control the entire robot, not just facial expressions, enabling full-body movement and lifelike interactions. To enhance communication and interaction, we plan to integrate multiple AI models, such as **large language models (LLMs)**, **text-to-speech (TTS)**, and other specialized models. These will allow the robot to understand, respond, and engage in meaningful conversations while adapting to different scenarios.  

By leveraging **NVIDIA Isaac ROS2**, we optimize real-time processing and motion control, ensuring smooth and intelligent responses. While InMoov serves as our initial testbed, our software is designed to be adaptable to other robotic platforms in the future.  

### Why InMoov ?

We chose **InMoov** because it is an **open-source (Creative Commons) robot platform** designed by French sculptor and designer **Gael Langevin**. Its open-source nature and the strong community behind it provide an ideal foundation for experimentation, collaboration, and continuous improvement.

## Technologies  
- **AI Integration**: Combining pre-trained models with a custom AI developed by our team.  
- **NVIDIA Isaac ROS2**: Leveraging NVIDIA's ROS2 framework for real-time robotic control and perception.  
- **Hardware**: We are also constructing the **InMoov** platform, enhancing its capabilities for human-like interaction.  

## Goals  
- Create lifelike facial expressions controlled by AI.  
- Seamlessly integrate custom and pre-existing AI models.  
- Optimize performance using NVIDIA Isaac ROS2.  

Stay tuned for updates as we push the boundaries of AI-driven robotics! 🚀
